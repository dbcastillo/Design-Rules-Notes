# Design-Rules-Notes 
  Principles + Practices for Great UI Design
  * UI Design Mantra 1: design is design is design (how humans react to what they see and why)
  * UI Design Mantra 2: stop solving other people's problems (your probs are your own)
  * UI Design Mantra 3: form doesn't & shouldn't follow function (the two have to work together)
  * UI Design Mantra 4: every force evolves form (impact forces play a role in what it looks like)
  * UI Design Mantra 5: on small screens, less is more  (we want quick, ease of use, and simple)
  * UI Design Mantra 6 : balance creates visual order & signals relationships  (individual elements do not compete with the whole)


## 1. Ground Rules
  What You Need to Know Upfront
  - design is solving problems, not drawing pictures
  - does the design serve the purpose of its existence? (context of use)
  - how should it be perceived? 
  - nothing in UI design is ever arbitrary
  - don't look at themes; they don't tell us anything about problems to solve
    - you will not find inspiration looking at the work of others
    - you will find someone else's solution to someone else's problem
    - the problem you have to solve belongs exclusively to you
  - don't look at trends
    - flat design doesn't consider appropriateness or whether people will understand what they see
    - don't rely on instincts as to what looks good and what doesn't
    - think hard about the appropriateness of visual decisions; let them be informed by research, investigation, and fact
  - form must follow function
    - louis sullivan manifesto 1896
    - frank lloyd wright was an intern of his
      - believed the two should be in union
      - his application of the principle was the Guggenheim museum
    - Bauhaus was the foundation for modern graphic design
    - *** Great Resource *** Universal Principles of Design
    - form doesn't and shouldn't follow function
      - the two things affect eachother, one doesn't supersede the other
      - what will set you apart is your understanding of why you make the visual decisons that you make
      - if the form of a design was ruled solely by its function, then every function item would have only one design solution. Every element would have the same design.
      - do you need to know the mechanics of how something works in order to use it?
      - as users we don't care how it works
        - our focus is the experience and our expectations of it
        - we have a mental model that predicts the experience
        - when UI sticks to our mental model, use is easier...we buy, share, etc
    - form should be determined by success critera (not funct or personal pref)
      - we are interested in outcomes not features
      - what aspects of the design are critical to success?
  - many forces affect the design and development process
    - audience needs, client desires, ethical obligations, aesthetic inclinations, tech constraints, cultural presuppositions, funct reqs, material properties, avail time, avail budget, avail resources
    - balancing act between UI design, info archit, frontend html/css, middle tier logic, backend data struc, prog & processes
  - if it's too complex, we assume it's hard to use
  - icons without labels are worse than labels alone
  - if an opp to interact isn't visible, we assume it isn't avail
  - small screen design
    - focus on context of use, when are they doing this
    - simplify, each screen should contain one primary action
    - design for thumbs, things within easy thumb reach
    - design for fat fingers, right size, right space b/w icons
    - minimize the need to type
    - less is more

## 2. Organizing Visual Information
  - ensure pos & neg space fit together so one doesn't overpower the other
  - individual elements shouldn't compete with the whole
  - the job of balance is to create order and signal relationships
  - balanced space allows user to quickly scan and group related elements
  - negative space works to signal visual hierarchy

## 3. Using Color and Contrast Appropriately

## 4. Designing with Typography and Imagery

## 5. Creating and Simplifying Visual Cues

## 6. Things to Remember
